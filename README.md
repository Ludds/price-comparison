# Web-scrapper
A script for comparing prices of a product and get notified when it drops in price

**Disclamer:**
This is my first script in python

**To do:**
* ~~Fix so the script dosent crash if user enters incorrect mail/password~~
* ~~Fix so the user can re-search for a product if it canâ€™t be found~~
* Clean up code
